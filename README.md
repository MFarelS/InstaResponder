## Installation
### Using Composer
```sh
composer require mgp25/instagram-php
composer require juanmicl/dummiesflow
```
### I don't have Composer
You can download it [here](https://getcomposer.org/download/).
#### _Warning about moving data to a different server_
_Composer checks your system's capabilities and selects libraries based on your **current** machine (where you are running the `composer` command). So if you run Composer on machine `A` to install this library, it will check machine `A`'s capabilities and will install libraries appropriate for that machine (such as installing the PHP 7+ versions of various libraries). If you then move your whole installation to machine `B` instead, it **will not work** unless machine `B` has the **exact** same capabilities (same or higher PHP version and PHP extensions)! Therefore, you should **always** run the Composer-command on your intended target machine instead of your local machine._
